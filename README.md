# Basic Apple Weather App

This weather app design is a simple, static interface for Weather App built with SwiftUI. It features a clean, light blue gradient background. At the top, the location is displayed in white text. Below that, a partly cloudy icon (a sun with a cloud) accompanies the current temperature, shown as "76°" in large, bold white text. Underneath, a 5-day forecast is presented in a horizontal row, with each day (Tue to Sat) showing a weather icon (e.g., sun, rain, storm) and a temperature (e.g., 74°, 90°, 82°, 98°, 72°). At the bottom, a "Light/Dark Mode!" button allows theme toggling. The layout is non-scrollable and minimalistic, focusing on essential weather information.
